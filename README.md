    This is a short description about Lab2 

    I created a folder named lab2-html and added the necessary files, including index.html and README.md. To create README.md, I used Visual Studio Code to ensure proper setup. I added some html code in the index.html file, I fixed several validation errors, starting with removing an extra "htm" before <!DOCTYPE html>, ensuring the document structure was correct. I added a missing <title> inside the <head>. Additionally, I addressed a warning about a <section> lacking a heading by adding an <h2> and updating the rest of the <h> tags. The other option i had was to replace <section> with <div> where appropriate because a section always include <h> tag and in my case i had none. These changes improved the HTML structure, ensuring a clean and valid web page.
